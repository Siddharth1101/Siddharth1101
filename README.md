## About Me

Hi! I'm a Product Manager at a Bay Area startup working on enterprise SaaS and an MBA candidate at the Yale School of Management. Yes, I retain both student and fulltime work statuses because of the uniqueness of my degree - the Silver Scholars MBA. Previously, I was a Product Manager at an AI/hardware startup. I completed my Bachelor's (Honors) in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning from IIT Madras, India. 

A passionate problem-solver, I'm highly interested in the confluence of business, deep technology and productization capabilites, and their impact on society. What kind of business strategies can firms adopt to sustainably grow and arrive at human-like decision making at scale is a question that captivates me. I'm also enthusiastic about interdisciplinary roles at the intersection of AI, product management and finance.

In the past I've worked with Yale Ventures, an EdTech startup, 180 Degrees Consulting, and a supply chain. 

### My top programming languages

Python, R, SQL, MATLAB, C++, C, Stata.

From my undergraduate experience, I've also crossed paths with *Verilog, ARM, AVR* as well as extensive Linux and commandline programming.

I predominantly use Visual Studio Code and Jupyter notebooks for the majority of my coding assignments involving Python/C++. Other applications/OS I frequently use are Git, Linux and MATLAB. 

### Technical Skills

Deep Learning (Pytorch and occasionally, TensorFlow), Data Science (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, etc.), Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing

My final-year thesis was on *Lowlight Image Captioning* at the [Image Processing and Computer Vision Lab, IIT Madras](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/) guided by [Prof. A.N. Rajagopalan](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/raju/).

Some of my favorite undergraduate courses include: Information Theory, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Econometrics, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Estimation Theory, Digital Signal Processing, Control Engineering, Communication Systems

Additionally, other technical skills: TensorFlow, WinSCP, Computer Organization and Architecture, Multi-armed bandits
