## About Me

Hi! I'm currently a Product Management Engineer in the Enterprise Networking group at Cisco. I primarily focus on AI in the Cloud Connectivity team.

Most recently, I was an MBA intern in the CEO's office at Connecticut Innovations. Before that, I was a summer associate at Bain & Company. And even before that, I was in the Bay Area and worked as a Product Manager at 2 startups: in customer success SaaS, and AI/hardware. I completed my Bachelor's (Honors) in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning from IIT Madras, India. 

A passionate problem-solver, I'm highly interested in the confluence of business, deep tech, investing and its positive impact on society. 

Other organizations I've had roles in the past include Z5 Capital, Yale Ventures, 180 Degrees Consulting, ITC Limited, and Embibe. 

### My top programming languages

Python, R, SQL, MATLAB, C++, C, Stata.

From my undergraduate experience, I've also crossed paths with *Verilog, ARM, AVR* as well as extensive Linux and commandline programming.

I predominantly use Visual Studio Code and Jupyter notebooks for the majority of my coding assignments involving Python/C++. Other applications/OS I frequently use are Git, Linux and MATLAB. 

### Technical Skills

Deep Learning (Pytorch and occasionally, TensorFlow), Data Science (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, etc.), Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing

My final-year thesis was on *Lowlight Image Captioning* at the [Image Processing and Computer Vision Lab, IIT Madras](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/) guided by [Prof. A.N. Rajagopalan](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/raju/).

Some of my favorite undergraduate courses include: Information Theory, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Econometrics, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Estimation Theory, Digital Signal Processing, Control Engineering, Communication Systems

Additionally, other technical skills: TensorFlow, WinSCP, Computer Organization and Architecture, Multi-armed bandits
