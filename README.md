## About Me

Hi! I'm a first-year MBA student at the Yale School of Management pursuing a Management Science concentration. Previously, I completed my Bachelor of technology (Honors) in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning from IIT Madras, India. 

A passionate problem-solver, I'm highly interested in the confluence of business, optimization and technology, and their impact on society. What kind of business strategies can firms adopt to sustainably grow and arrive at human-like decision making at scale is a question that captivates me. I'm also enthusiastic about interdisciplinary roles at the intersection of AI, Strategy and investing.

Currently working with a Venture Capital firm, I've worked with an EdTech startup, digital transformation, supply chains, strategy and deep learning. 

### My top programming languages

Python, R, SQL, MATLAB, C++, C, Stata

From my undergraduate experience, I've also crossed paths with *Verilog, ARM, AVR*

I predominantly use Visual Studio Code and Jupyter notebooks for the majority of my coding assignments involving Python/C++. Other applications/OS I frequently use are Git, Linux and MATLAB. 

### Technical Skills

Deep Learning (Pytorch and occasionally, TensorFlow), Data Science (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, etc.), Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing

My final-year thesis was on *Lowlight Image Captioning* at the [Image Processing and Computer Vision Lab, IIT Madras](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/) guided by [Prof. A.N. Rajagopalan](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/raju/).

Some of my favorite undergraduate courses include: Information Theory, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Econometrics, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Estimation Theory, Digital Signal Processing, Control Engineering, Communication Systems

Additionally, other technical skills: TensorFlow, WinSCP, Computer Organization and Architecture, Multi-armed bandits
