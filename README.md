## About Me

Hi! I'm a first-year MBA student at the Yale School of Management pursuing a Management Science concentration. Previously, I completed my Bachelor of technology (Honors) in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning from IIT Madras, India. 

A passionate problem-solver, I'm highly interested in the confluence of business, economics and technology, and their impact on society. What kind of business strategies can firms adopt to sustainably grow and arrive at human-like decision making at scale is a question that captivates me. I'm also enthusiastic about interdisciplinary roles at the intersection of AI, consulting, product management and strategic transformation.

### My top programming languages

Python, R, SQL, MATLAB, C++, C, Stata

### Technical Skills

Deep Learning (Pytorch), Data Science (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, etc.), Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing
